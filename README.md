# **Ideas**

O ![](RackMultipart20200827-4-1wpq8wn_html_e686ee4f27f71a2a.png) ur product for this project is **AmazContacts** (short for Amazing Contacts) – a contact book for Android users. This idea came across when one of us was using the default built-in contact book in his phone and wondered how it worked. So we decided to develop our own contact book, both for project assessment and for learning purposes.

We want to develop a good-looking, easy-to-use contact book with basic functions of a phonebook and some unique ones that you can only find in **AmazContacts**.
